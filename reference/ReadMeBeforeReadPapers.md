#####My idea:

Used methods in *Quasi-static, 1988* (peg in hole problem) to analyze compliant screwdriving 

the geometry and spatial kinematics & dynamics of screwdriving is much more complex.

Maybe we cannot find an exact way to solve it but some methods to approximate it? (like system identification?  I'm not sure)

:D
