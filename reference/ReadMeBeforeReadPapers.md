**Xianyi's idea:**

* Used methods in *Quasi-static, 1988* (peg in hole problem) to analyze the role of compliance in screwdriving .
* The geometry and spatial kinematics & dynamics of screwdriving is much more complex. Probably we need to switch from 2D to 3D.
* Maybe we cannot find an exact way to solve it but some methods to approximate it? (like system identification?  I'm not sure)
* :D
